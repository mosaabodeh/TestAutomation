# TestAutomation
In this assignment, I used the cypress to make an automatic test for 10 test bags. I treat them manually.
In the test bag that was covered with the test:
search about Usernamepassed
search for non-existing thing passed
search for first namepassed
search for last name passed
search for emailpassed
Add new staff passed
edit first name field passed
edit the last name passed
edit the email field passed
Edit its authorization to Write passed

Of course, each unit of them has a method and has requirements. Some of them are similar, and some of them are not similar. I did them in two ways. Of course, the first is that they are all in one bag and the second bag is fast. As I will hand you, each bag is a bag on its own.
A simple explanation about them: search about User name. He wants to search for the staff through the username in it. Of course, there are conditions. I tried to explain the code in a comment and tried to make it understandable as much as I could. The rest of them are the same. 
# Note there are 2 files {testcases} that u cheack (تصلحه)  the file {FastWayTEst} just for u to see another way to solove 
# Note that change the user name befor add new user in AddUser Test to run it ....
